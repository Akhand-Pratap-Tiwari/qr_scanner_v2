# qr_scanner_v2
So, there was an emergency request from a club to make a qr scanner app that can scan qr and then do R/W operations on the DB. I had to make the app in 3 hrs and it was working but was not polished. This is the v2 of the same app with much more polished UI and code organization. This app scans the QR ticket and tells whether the person is registered on database or not. After the entry is confirmed, it also updates the database to avoid duplicates. It can be used by multiple persons in parallel for scanning distinct tickets.

A further plan is to work with the team that was working on the system and set up a deployable pipeline and integrate this app with it so that anyone can use this system for the ticket management at the club events held at the college.
##To do for Future:
Better code organization by doing more granualar widget abstraction.
